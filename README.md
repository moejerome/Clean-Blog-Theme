# Clean Blog #

Been practicing my HTML/CSS skills lately and decided to take a stab at templating. I took the Clean Blog template developed by the fine folks at [Start Bootstrap](http://startbootstrap.com) and threw together this template for [Habari](http://habariproject.org).

It's currently in alpha, the theme functions as the webt conterpart but it's not quite there yet.
