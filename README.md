# Clean Blog for Habari #

![Clean-Blog](screenshot.png "Clean Blog sample post page")

Been practicing my HTML/CSS skills lately and decided to take a stab at template work. I took the Clean Blog template developed by the fine folks at [Start Bootstrap](http://startbootstrap.com) and threw together this template for [Habari](http://habariproject.org).

It's currently in alpha, the theme functions as the web counterpart but it's not quite there yet. Header images are pretty static (one for home, one for single entires and one for page entires). They can be changed out on the fly by updating the appropriate img.  

The template does support menus created in Habari. They will automatically fill out the navbar. 

## To-Do List ##

* Allow for custom header images on posts and pages
* Logo support
* Subtitle support
